The Venous Return Assist Leg Sleeve (VERA Sleeve) is a wearable device for management of the chronic leg problems that patients with post-thrombotic syndrome experience following a deep venous thrombosis. This device is being developed as a project for the two-quarter-long course series BIOE 141A: *Senior Capstone Biodesign* at Stanford University in the 2015-2016 academic year.

## Contents
This repository contains unit testing code for various subsystems of the test fixtures we will use in developing the device. This repository will also contain code to control the device.

## Dependencies
Some unit tests are designed for execution with the Arduino IDE and its Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter utilities. All other code is written for Python 3.x, with the following libraries:
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for signal processing.
* [Nanpy](https://nanpy.github.io/) for serial communication with the Arduino.
